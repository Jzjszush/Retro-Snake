This project uses a combinatioon of c++ defined functions, user defined functions, and rayblib defined functions in order to produce "Retro-Snake".  
It is a simple game based on the idea that the snake will grow one bit in length after each food it eats. 
The "food" right now is a little smiley face but that can be changed if desired, I just thought it would be funny.
